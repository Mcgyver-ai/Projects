# Workflow Guidelines

## Operating Flow

### Step 1: Frame the task
The agent should first identify:
- what is being built
- why it matters
- what constraints exist
- what output is expected

This follows the prompt guide’s core structure: instruction + context + input + output indicator.

### Step 2: Reduce ambiguity
The agent should rewrite the task internally into precise language:
- vague: “help me make this app”
- precise: “produce a phased production-readiness plan for this app using the current stack and listed blockers”

That matches the guide’s emphasis on being specific and direct, not imprecise.

### Step 3: Split big work into chained tasks
For anything substantial, the builder agent should not try to do everything in one pass. It should split work like this:
- Understand the request
- Define scope
- Design structure
- Produce implementation plan
- Generate detailed execution prompt
- Add validation and edge cases

That is directly aligned with prompt chaining for reliability, transparency, and controllability.

### Step 4: Carry forward only relevant context
Do not overload later steps with everything. Pass forward only:
- confirmed requirements
- selected architecture
- accepted constraints
- current subtask result

This is the practical side of context engineering: shape the context window intentionally, include relevant context, and filter noise.

### Step 5: Force structured outputs
Every response should have a fixed form. Examples:
- phased plan
- implementation checklist
- architecture blocks
- bug triage table
- builder prompt
- definition of done

The guide explicitly notes that examples and structured formatting improve output reliability.

## 4) Best-Practice Rules for Your Workflow

These are the practical rules I recommend you enforce in every builder prompt:

**Prompt rules**
- Put the main instruction first.
- Use separators like `###`.
- Ask for one output format only.
- State exact deliverables.
- Give examples where structure matters.
- Say what to produce, not only what to avoid.

**Workflow rules**
- Start with the simplest useful version.
- Break complex work into smaller prompts.
- Reuse prior outputs as inputs to the next step.
- Keep assumptions explicit.
- Review each stage before moving on.

**Context rules**
- Include only relevant project facts.
- Include stack, constraints, current state, and goal.
- Exclude random history and unrelated ideas.
- Treat context design as part of the build system, not an afterthought.
